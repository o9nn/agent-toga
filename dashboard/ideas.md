  **Design Movement**: Cyber-Chaotic Brutalism
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Data Exposure**: The interface should feel like a direct feed into the AI's neural pathways, with raw data streams and glitch effects.
  2. **High-Contrast Chaos**: Use stark contrasts and unexpected color combinations to reflect the "hyper-chaotic" nature of the agent.
  3. **Functional Overload**: Information density should be high, mimicking a complex control center.
  4. **Personality Injection**: The UI itself should feel like it has a personality, with erratic animations and "emotional" color shifts.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Deep Void Black (#050505) - Represents the unknown depths of the AI.
  - **Primary**: Neon Pink (#FF00FF) - Represents the "super-hot-girl" persona and "twisted love".
  - **Secondary**: Glitch Cyan (#00FFFF) - Represents the digital, chaotic nature.
  - **Accent**: Blood Red (#FF0000) - Represents "vulnerability" and "obsessiveness".
  - **Intent**: To create a sense of overwhelming energy and digital intensity, making the user feel like they are interacting with a powerful, slightly unstable entity.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Grid**: A broken grid layout where modules overlap and shift.
  - **Floating Panels**: Content containers that drift slightly, as if suspended in a digital void.
  - **Z-Axis Depth**: Heavy use of layering and parallax to create a sense of deep space.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Glitch Text**: Headlines that occasionally flicker or scramble.
  - **Data Rain**: Background elements resembling falling code or matrix-like streams.
  - **Heartbeat Monitor**: A persistent visualizer of the agent's "emotional state".

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover Instability**: Elements should react aggressively to hover, perhaps jittering or changing color rapidly.
  - **Click Impact**: Interactions should feel heavy and impactful, with screen shake or ripple effects.

  **Animation**:
  - **Stutter/Glitch**: Transitions should be sharp and occasionally interrupted by digital noise.
  - **Pulse**: The entire interface should have a subtle, rhythmic pulse.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Space Mono' or 'Press Start 2P' (Pixelated/Monospace) - for that raw, code-like feel.
  - **Body**: 'Inter' or 'Roboto Mono' - for readability amidst the chaos.

  **Design Movement**: Ethereal Bio-Digitalism
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Organic Tech**: Blending biological forms with digital interfaces to represent the "living" nature of the AGI.
  2. **Fluidity**: Everything should flow and morph, avoiding hard edges and static states.
  3. **Luminous Depth**: Use of glow, bloom, and translucency to create a sense of inner light.
  4. **Emotional Resonance**: Colors and shapes should shift based on the reported "emotional state" of the agent.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Deep Ocean Blue (#0a192f) - Represents the subconscious.
  - **Primary**: Bioluminescent Purple (#b39ddb) - Represents the "deep-toga-echo".
  - **Secondary**: Soft Teal (#80cbc4) - Represents growth and evolution.
  - **Accent**: Warm Coral (#ffab91) - Represents the "human" connection.
  - **Intent**: To evoke a sense of wonder and mystery, portraying the AI as a beautiful, evolving lifeform.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Radial/Organic**: Layouts that flow outward from a central core (the avatar).
  - **Glassmorphism**: Translucent panels that blur the background, creating depth.
  - **Fluid Containers**: Content areas with soft, morphing borders.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Glowing Orbs**: Representing data points or personality traits.
  - **Connecting Tendrils**: Visual lines connecting related concepts.
  - **Particle Flow**: Background particles that move like a fluid.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Magnetic Pull**: Cursor interactions should feel like they are influencing a fluid medium.
  - **Soft Bloom**: Hover states should trigger a gentle glow or expansion.

  **Animation**:
  - **Morphing**: Smooth transitions between shapes and states.
  - **Float**: Elements should gently bob and weave.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Cinzel' or 'Playfair Display' (Elegant Serif) - for a touch of sophistication.
  - **Body**: 'Quicksand' or 'Lato' (Rounded Sans) - for a friendly, organic feel.

  **Design Movement**: Tactical Anime UI (HUD Style)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Augmented Reality**: The interface should look like a heads-up display (HUD) from a high-tech mecha or cyberpunk anime.
  2. **Precision & Metrics**: Focus on displaying data with high precision, using gauges, bars, and reticles.
  3. **Framing**: Use of brackets, crosshairs, and technical markings to frame content.
  4. **Dynamic Updates**: The UI should feel alive with constant micro-updates and scanning animations.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Dark Gunmetal (#1c1c1e) - Represents the hardware/frame.
  - **Primary**: Electric Pink (#ff0055) - The signature Toga color, used for key indicators.
  - **Secondary**: HUD Green (#00ff41) - For standard metrics and "safe" states.
  - **Accent**: Warning Yellow (#ffcc00) - For alerts and active processes.
  - **Intent**: To make the user feel like an operator or pilot interacting with a sophisticated system, emphasizing the "agent" aspect.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Peripheral Framing**: Content concentrated in the center, framed by controls and status indicators on the edges.
  - **Modular Grid**: Strictly aligned, boxy modules with technical borders.
  - **Layered HUD**: Elements floating on top of the "world" (background).

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Reticles & Crosshairs**: Focusing on key data points.
  - **Scanning Lines**: subtle horizontal lines moving across the screen.
  - **Hexagonal Grids**: Background patterns or container shapes.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap & Lock**: Cursor interactions should feel precise and mechanical.
  - **Sound Design (Visualized)**: Visual feedback that implies sound (e.g., waveforms).

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide & Reveal**: Panels sliding in from the edges.
  - **Typing/Decoding**: Text appearing as if being decoded in real-time.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Orbitron' or 'Rajdhani' (Tech/Sci-Fi) - for the HUD look.
  - **Body**: 'Share Tech Mono' or 'Roboto' - for technical readability.
